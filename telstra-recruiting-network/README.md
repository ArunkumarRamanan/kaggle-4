# Telstra Network Disruptions

From competition page:

In their first recruiting competition, Telstra is challenging Kagglers to predict the severity of service disruptions on their network. Using a dataset of features from their service logs, you're tasked with predicting if a disruption is a momentary glitch or a total interruption of connectivity.

The main improvement was form the fact that the target value depends from order of the lines in the competition data files.
